      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        The human skeleton not only helps the body stand upright while a person is walking or sitting,
        it goes a little further, since this structure allows for maintaining correct order and organization within the organism.
        It is also known as the bone or skeletal system.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        It acts as a kind of mechanical support and basis for posture.
        The capacity of its structure, as well as its strength and rigidity, allows the entire body to maintain the correct morphology of the body,
        thus allowing humans to walk without problems on two legs.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-800 mb-4">Protection & Functional Role</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        The human skeleton is a shield for the human body, since each bone properly protects the organs inside.
        These aspects can be clearly reflected in the case of the brain, which is protected by the skull, just as the rib cage protects the heart, lungs, among others.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        This skeletal system has the main characteristic of being a filter or moderator of the exchange of calcium, phosphate and salts.
        Once this system reaches adulthood, it has 206 bones in its entire composition, which are perfectly supported by other systems,
        such as ligaments, cartilage and bones.

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Ligaments are very flexible tissues that allow cushioning and protection between bones.
        Cartilage is a semi-rigid connective tissue that covers bone surfaces at joints,
        providing flexibility and resistance to mechanical stress.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Bones are rigid, mineralized structures—among the hardest in the human body.
        Inside bones is bone marrow, responsible for hematopoietic functions (production of red blood cells),
        and containing adipose tissue, blood vessels, and nerves.

        This problem refers to an alteration in the growth and development of the jaws — the central bone of the face and the jaw bone.
        To solve this, orthodontic treatment is commonly used with a dental appliance known as an <strong>extraoral arch</strong>, also called a <em>"horse bit"</em>.

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        A bone fissure is a crack in the bone that does not fully break it, maintaining bone continuity.
        If left untreated, the issue can worsen and compromise the bone’s function.
        Treatment usually involves <strong>casts or splints</strong>, which immobilize the affected area and allow proper healing.

        This is a complete break of the femur, the longest and strongest bone in the human body.
        Due to its size and function, <strong>casts are not typically used</strong>.
        Instead, treatment involves:

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mt-2 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Internal fixation</strong>: screws, nails, or metal plates are inserted to realign the bone.</li>
        <li><strong>External fixation</strong>: a device worn outside the skin helps stabilize and correct the bone structure.</li>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Nanorobots could be assembled in the affected area, forming <strong>temporary structures</strong> that stabilize bones without bulky devices.
        In mandibular disharmony, nanorobots would apply <strong>constant micro-adjustments</strong> to align the teeth,
        eliminating the need for frequent dentist visits.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        For bone fissures and fixations, nanorobots could create a <strong>protective barrier</strong> that stabilizes the bone while it regenerates,
        allowing the patient to maintain mobility without compromising recovery.

      <img src="https://s1.abcstatics.com/Media/201410/27/hueso--644x362.jpg" alt="bone repair " width="300" height="200">
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        To treat bone fractures, jaw irregularities, and structural fixations, nanorobots would travel <strong>through bone tissue</strong>,
        not through the skin or blood vessels.
      </p>
      <img src="https://www.tecnologianano.com/tecnowp16/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nanorobot-cuerpo-humano.jpg " alt="Descripción de la imagen" width="300" height="200">
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        The process begins with the <strong>implantation of nanorobots</strong> into the body. These are programmed to detect affected bone areas.
        They move through tiny channels in the bone, called <em>canaliculi</em>, which connect to bone cells.
        This avoids damaging sensitive surrounding tissues.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Once in the target area, nanorobots form <strong>adaptive temporary structures</strong> to stabilize fractures or realign bones.
        For jaw irregularities, precise changes are made directly to the bone without daily orthodontic tools.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        After healing, nanorobots either <strong>disintegrate naturally</strong> or reintegrate with the bone safely,
        leaving no harmful traces in the body.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        This innovative approach could help avoid invasive surgery and eliminate the need for <strong>splints, external fixators, or casts</strong>,
        offering a more comfortable and efficient recovery process.
